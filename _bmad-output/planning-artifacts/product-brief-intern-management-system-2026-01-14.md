# Product Brief: Intern Management System

<!-- Content will be appended sequentially through collaborative workflow steps -->

## Executive Summary

Intern Management System is a centralized Intern Management System designed to transform the chaotic, manual, and fragmented process of college internship hiring into a structured, scalable, and secure digital workflow. By consolidating student shortlisting, multi-round placement tracking, document verification, and offer letter generation into a single source of truth, Intern Management System empowers HR teams to manage hundreds of candidates across multiple colleges with precision and efficiency.

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Currently, the internship hiring lifecycle at Wissen is spread across disconnected emails and spreadsheets. This "unstructured digital paper trail" makes coordinating with multiple colleges nearly impossible to manage without high risk of error.

### Problem Impact

The **Wissen HR/Admin Team** faces the most acute pain, spending excessive hours manually updating round results, chasing documents, and generating offers. The lack of structure leads to:
- **Operational Risk:** High probability of sending incorrect offers or missing top-tier candidates.
- **Compliance Issues:** Difficulty in ensuring all required documents are collected and verified.
- **Communication Overhead:** College Placement Coordinators are left in the dark, leading to constant status inquiries via phone and email.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Traditional spreadsheets lack the real-time collaboration, notification triggers, and specialized workflows required for a multi-round placement process. Existing generic HRIS tools often aren't tailored for the specific college-to-corporate internship funnel, making them either too heavy or too rigid for Wissen's needs.

### Proposed Solution

Intern Management System provides a unified dashboard that tracks every student from the moment they are shortlisted by their college through to the final offer letter. It automates the "busy work"—status updates, document collection, and offer generation—allowing HR to focus on talent selection rather than data entry.

### Key Differentiators

- **College-Centric Onboarding:** Seamless integration for placement coordinators to shortlist and track their students.
- **Automated Lifecycle Management:** Multi-round tracking with integrated document verification steps.
- **Structure over Chaos:** A purpose-built workflow that eliminates the "spreadsheet silos" and ensures compliance at every stage.
